Lingua-EN-CMUDict version 0.01
==============================

This perl module exists as an interface to an augmented version of the CMU 
pronunciation dictionary that contains syllable boundaries.  The paper 
related to this data is  by Susan Bartlett, Grzegorz Kondrak and Colin Cherry;
On the Syllabification of Phonemes, NAACL-HLT 2009.  Utilizing this version
of the dictionary we can easily determine the number of syllables in a word 
as well as find rhymes.

The tool mkdbfile.pl in the tools directory can be used to create new db
files used by the perl module.
